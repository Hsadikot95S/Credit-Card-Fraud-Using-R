# Credit-Card-Fraud-Using-R

# Detecting Credit Card Fraud 
This is a data science project with machine learning in R.

## Aim of Project
The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. I used a variety of machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and finally, Gradient Boosting Classifier that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent ones.

### Dataset used 
For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, I used the [Card Transactions dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CTAlmlREFRaEN3NoHHitewpqAtWS5cVQ/view) that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.
